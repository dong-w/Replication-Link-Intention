## Abstract
Code reviews serve as a quality assurance activity for software teams.Especially for Modern Code Review, sharing a link during a review discussionsallows review teams as an effective awareness mechanism where“Code reviews aregood FYIs [for your information].”Although prior work has explored link sharingand the information needs of a code review, the extent to which links are used to properly conduct a review is unknown. In this study, we performed a mixed-method approach to investigate the practice of link sharing and their intentions.First, through a quantitative study of the OpenStack and Qt ecosystem of projects,we identify 19,268 patches that have 39,686 links to explore the extent to whichthe links are shared, and analyze a correlation between link sharing and reviewtime. Then in a qualitative study, we analyze 400 links to understand the roleand usefulness of link sharing. Results indicate that internal links are more widelyreferred (93% and 80% for the two ecosystems). Importantly, although the majorityof the internal links are referencing to patches, bug reports and source code are alsoshared in review discussions. The number of internal links as an explanatory factordoes have an increasing relationship with the review time. Finally, we presentseven common intentions of link sharing, with the context understanding beingthe most often used. To conduct a proper review, we encourage the patch authorto provide clear context and explore both internal and external resources, whilereview teams should continue link sharing activities. Future research directionsinclude the investigation of causality between sharing links and the review process,as well as the potential for tool support.
